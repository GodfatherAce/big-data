Week 1 Assignment - Exploring NYC Taxi Data using SQL
---------------------------------------

The NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) captures information about each taxi trip in the City. In this assignment, you will use mysql to 'play' with a subset of these data: trips that took place between August 1 and  August 7, 2013. You can access the data at: https://www.mediafire.com/folder/1zaqzcf722loc/taxi_data_aug_week1

Each trip contains information about pickup and dropoff location, pickup and dropoff time, and a number of other attributes including fare, tip, and distance traveled. The TLC releases the data in two files: one containing trip data and another fare data.

You will start by creating two tables, one for fares and one for trips and load the data into these tables. Here are the CREATE TABLE statements you should use:
CREATE TABLE trips (
       medallion varchar(50),
       hack_license varchar(50),
       vendor_id VARCHAR(3),
       rate_code SMALLINT,
       store_and_fwd_flag VARCHAR(3),
       pickup_datetime TIMESTAMP,
       dropoff_datetime TIMESTAMP,
       passenger_count SMALLINT,
       trip_time_in_secs INT,
       trip_distance DECIMAL(12,5),
       pickup_longitude DECIMAL(15,10),
       pickup_latitude DECIMAL(15,10),
       dropoff_longitude DECIMAL(15,10),
       dropoff_latitude DECIMAL(15,10)
);

CREATE TABLE fares (
       medallion varchar(50),
       hack_license varchar(50),
       vendor_id VARCHAR(3),
       pickup_datetime TIMESTAMP,
       payment_type VARCHAR(3),
       fare_amount DECIMAL(15,10),
       surcharge DECIMAL(15,10),
       mta_tax DECIMAL(15,10),
       tip_amount DECIMAL(15,10),
       tolls_amount DECIMAL(15,10),
       total_amount DECIMAL(15,10)
);

MySQL allows you to populate tables with data from CSV files. See the following for details: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/load-data.html
Assuming you saved the trip data in a file called trip_data_week1.csv, you can use the following command to load the trip data into the trips table.

LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'trip_data_week1.csv' 
INTO TABLE trips 
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n'
IGNORE 1 LINES;

===================================================================
 
* Task 1.  Write a SQL query that joins the 'trips' and 'fare' table and populates a new table called 'alltrips' table. Note that the 'fares' and 'trips' tables share
4 attributes:  medallion, hack, vendor_id, pickup datetime. 

* Task 2. Write the following queries in SQL to help you understand the data.

a) Find the distribution of fare amounts, i.e., for each amount A, the number of trips that cost A. The schema of the output should be: (amount, num_trips)
b) How many trips cost less than $10?
c) Find the distribution of the number of passengers.  The schema of the output should be: (number_of_passengers, num_trips)
d) Find the total revenue (for all taxis) per day. The schema of the output should be: (day, total_revenue).
e) Find the total number of trips for each taxi

* Task 3. Write SQL queries to help answer the questions below to help you identify potential problems with the data.

a) Is there more than one record for a given taxi at the same time? If there are any, what's interesting about it?
b) For each taxi, what is the percentage of trips without GPS coordinates, i.e., all 4 coordinates are recorded as 0's?
The output schema should be: (medallion, percentage_of_trips). 
c) Find the number of different taxis used by each driver. Can you identify anything unusual?

* Task 4. You will now use one additional data set that contains information about the actual vehicles used in the trips. You can obtain the data at: http://www.mediafire.com/view/6wziuzg5983q9oq/licenses.csv

Here's the schema you should use:
CREATE TABLE medallions (
       medallion varchar(50),
       name varchar(50),
       type varchar(30),
       current_status varchar(10),
       DMV_license_plate varchar(10),
       vehicle_VIN_number varchar(20),
       vehicle_type varchar(10),
       model_year DECIMAL(4),
       medallion_type varchar(30),
       agent_number INTEGER,
       agent_name varchar(30),
       agent_telephone_number varchar(15),
       agent_website varchar(50),
       agent_address varchar(50),
       last_updated_date DATE,
       last_updated_time TIME
);

a) Compare trips based on vehicle_type (WAV, HYB, CNG, LV1, DSE, NRML). 
   output schema: (vehicle_type, total_trips, total_revenue, avg_tip_percentage).
b) Compare trips based on medallion_type(Named Driver, Owner must drive). 
   output schema: (medallion_type, total_trips, total_revenue, avg_tip_percentage)
c) List the top 10 agents by total revenue.
